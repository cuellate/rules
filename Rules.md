Rules of Cuéllate (Señor Brown Edition), version 5  
Valid since: September 9, 2019

# I. Definitions
1. In these rules, A will refer to someone that forces a Cuéllate, B will refer to the person it's forced on, C will refer to Señor Brown, and D will refer to a student.
2. The main Cuéllate symbol is formed by extending your thumb out sideways, then touching your other fingers on that hand to it.
3. The Circle Game symbol, which may be used interchangeably with the main Cuéllate symbol, which has a Unicode point of 1F44C, is formed by connecting the thumb and index finger into a circle and holding the other fingers straight or relaxed away from the palm.
4. The Rules will refer to the Cuéllate symbol, meaning any symbol that can force a Cuéllate.

# II. Rules
## 1. Forcing a Cuéllate:
a. If B sees A showing the Cuéllate symbol, either physically or in a picture, A does not have more than one hundred active forced Cuéllate, and no restrictions (in Rule 7) apply, A has "forced a Cuéllate."  
b. If A forces a Cuéllate and no rules below state otherwise, B must slap themself on the back of their neck, or "neck themself."  
c. If A forces a Cuéllate on B, but B doesn't neck themself, A may slap you on the back of the neck, or "neck you."  
d. If B puts their index finger through the hole of the forced Cuéllate without looking at it, B has forced the Cuéllate, not A.  
e. C may create alternative ways to force a Cuéllate by agreement.  

## 2. Scoring:
a. One earns a point every time they force a Cuéllate and loses a point every time a Cuéllate is forced on them.  
b. The game may be played without scoring at all.  
c. The object of the game is to have one hundred and one active forced Cuéllate on someone for as long as possible.  
d. If A reaches one hundred and one active forced Cuéllate on B, A is their “Cuéllate Master.”

## 3. Test Days:
a. A test day is any day where C gives a major grade to D, or C is administering a standardized test required for D by someone other than C.  
b. C may force a Cuéllate on test days, but if D forces a Cuéllate on a test day, it is forced on them.

## 4. Past Forcing:
a. If A forces a Cuéllate on B, but neither A nor B neck B within 1 hour, the forced Cuéllate becomes inactive, and no points are scored.  
b. If A necks B without a valid forced Cuéllate, A must neck themselves, too, or B may neck A without a valid forced Cuéllate.  
c. If B necks themself even though A didn’t have a valid forced Cuéllate, no points are scored, so B cannot neck A.

## 5. Temporary Rule Changes:
a. C may temporarily add or change a rule other than this rule by stating “Changed Rule” followed by the number of the changed Rule and text of the Rule to add or change.  
b. C may temporarily void a rule by stating “Void Rule” followed by the number of the Rule to void.  
c. This change applies to any active forced Cuéllate, and all forced Cuéllate for one hour.  
d. The change is valid ten minutes before it was made, and one hour after.  
e. When a change becomes invalid, any completed actions done during the valid period are still legal, but the change is no longer in effect.  
f. C may invalidate a valid temporary rule change via another temporary rule change that invalidates it.  
g. Anyone may ask C, “I request information of any valid changes via Rule Five,” and C must state any temporary valid changes, without anything being done to the asker.

## 6. Permanent Rule Changes:
a. C may permanently change a rule by validating a new version of the Rule sheet, via Section 3, which invalidates any previous versions of the Rules.  
b. Modifications to this sheet by someone other than C are invalid, unless C validates and approves them.

## 7. Restrictions and Exemptions:
a. The restrictions on forcing a Cuéllate are the following:  
&#9;i. If physically, the Cuéllate symbol must be below A’s waist.  
&#9;ii. If in a picture, the picture must contain A’s face.  
b. A is exempt from the above Restrictions (they don’t apply) if A has a physical Exemption Pass signed and stamped by C, which states that the Restrictions in Rule 7 do not apply.

## 8. Opt-In and Opt-Out:
a. All current and former students of C have opted in automatically, and anyone else is opted out until they opt in.  
b. Someone opted out may opt in by necking themselves or by mutual agreement with C.  
c. To temporarily opt out, one may say, “I am opting out of Cuéllate via Rule Eight,” which enables them to opt out until twenty-eight days pass or they opt in, whichever is sooner.  
d. Someone cannot opt out multiple times in one day.  
e. Someone cannot opt out if someone has an active forced Cuéllate on them.  
f. If no activity occurs for one year for someone opted in, they have opted out automatically.  
g. C may opt someone out if it is determined that they do not have sufficient knowledge of the Rules, but they have attempted to play due to the influence of another.

# III. Validation
1. Any new version of the rules must be signed and stamped by C.
2. To validate the new version, C must publicly display the new version, which invalidates the previous version.
