Rules of Cuéllate (Señor Brown Edition), version 3  
Valid since: April 29, 2019

# I. Definitions
1. In these rules, A will refer to someone that forces a Cuéllate, B will refer to the person it's forced on, C will refer to Señor Brown, and D will refer to a student.
2. The Cuéllate symbol is formed by extending your thumb out sideways, then touching your other fingers on that hand to it.

# II. Rules
## 1. Forcing a Cuéllate:
a. If B sees A showing the Cuéllate symbol, either physically or in a picture, and no restrictions (in Rule 7) apply, A has "forced a Cuéllate."  
b. If A forces a Cuéllate and no rules below state otherwise, B must slap themself on the back of their neck, or "neck themself."  
c. If A forces a Cuéllate on B, but B doesn't neck themself, A may slap you on the back of the neck, or "neck you."

## 2. Scoring:
a. One earns a point every time they force a Cuéllate and loses a point every time a Cuéllate is forced on them.

## 3. Test Days:
a. A test day is any day where C gives a major grade to D, or C is administering a standardized test required for D by someone other than C.  
b. C may force a Cuéllate on test days, but if D forces a Cuéllate on a test day, it is forced on them.

## 4. Past Forcing:
a. If A forces a Cuéllate on B, but neither A nor B neck B within 1 hour, the forced Cuéllate ends, and no points are scored.  
b. If A necks B without a valid forced Cuéllate, A must neck themselves, too, or B may neck A without a valid forced Cuéllate.

## 5. Temporary Rule Changes:
a. C may temporarily add or change a rule by stating “Changed Rule” followed by the number of the changed Rule and text of the Rule to add or change.  
b. C may temporarily void a rule by stating “Void Rule” followed by the number of the Rule to void.  
c. This change applies to any active forced Cuéllate, and all forced Cuéllate for one hour.

## 6. Permanent Rule Changes:
a. C may permanently change a rule by validating a new version of the Rule sheet, which invalidates any previous versions of the Rules.  
b. Modifications to this sheet by someone other than C are invalid, unless C validates and approves them.

## 7. Restrictions and Exemptions:
a. The restrictions on forcing a Cuéllate are the following:  
&#9;i. If physically, the Cuéllate symbol must be below A’s waist.  
&#9;ii. If in a picture, the picture must contain A’s face.  
b. A is exempt from the above Restrictions (they don’t apply) if A has a physical Exemption Pass signed and stamped by C, which states that the Restrictions in Rule 7 do not apply.

# III. Validation
1. In order for the rules to be valid, they must be signed and stamped by C.
2. Once that happens, C must inform that the rules have changed and publicly display the new version.
