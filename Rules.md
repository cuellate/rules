Rules of Cuéllate (Señor Brown Edition), version 4  
Valid since: August 19, 2019

# I. Definitions
1. In these rules, A will refer to someone that forces a Cuéllate, B will refer to the person it's forced on, C will refer to Señor Brown, and D will refer to a student.
2. The Cuéllate symbol is formed by extending your thumb out sideways, then touching your other fingers on that hand to it.

# II. Rules
## 1. Forcing a Cuéllate:
a. If B sees A showing the Cuéllate symbol, either physically or in a picture, and no restrictions (in Rule 7) apply, A has "forced a Cuéllate."  
b. If A forces a Cuéllate and no rules below state otherwise, B must slap themself on the back of their neck, or "neck themself."  
c. If A forces a Cuéllate on B, but B doesn't neck themself, A may slap you on the back of the neck, or "neck you."

## 2. Scoring:
a. One earns a point every time they force a Cuéllate and loses a point every time a Cuéllate is forced on them.  
b. The game may be played without scoring at all.

## 3. Test Days:
a. A test day is any day where C gives a major grade to D, or C is administering a standardized test required for D by someone other than C.  
b. C may force a Cuéllate on test days, but if D forces a Cuéllate on a test day, it is forced on them.

## 4. Past Forcing:
a. If A forces a Cuéllate on B, but neither A nor B neck B within 1 hour, the forced Cuéllate ends, and no points are scored.  
b. If A necks B without a valid forced Cuéllate, A must neck themselves, too, or B may neck A without a valid forced Cuéllate.  
c. If B necks themself even though A didn’t have a valid forced Cuéllate, no points are scored, so B cannot neck A.

## 5. Temporary Rule Changes:
a. C may temporarily add or change a rule other than this rule by stating “Changed Rule” followed by the number of the changed Rule and text of the Rule to add or change.  
b. C may temporarily void a rule by stating “Void Rule” followed by the number of the Rule to void. This change applies to any active forced Cuéllate, and all forced Cuéllate for one hour.  
c. Anyone may ask C, “I request information of any valid changes via Rule Five,” and C must state any temporary valid changes, without anything being done to the asker.

## 6. Permanent Rule Changes:
a. C may permanently change a rule by validating a new version of the Rule sheet, via Section 3, which invalidates any previous versions of the Rules.  
b. Modifications to this sheet by someone other than C are invalid, unless C validates and approves them.

## 7. Restrictions and Exemptions:
a. The restrictions on forcing a Cuéllate are the following:  
&#9;i. If physically, the Cuéllate symbol must be below A’s waist.  
&#9;ii. If in a picture, the picture must contain A’s face.  
b. A is exempt from the above Restrictions (they don’t apply) if A has a physical Exemption Pass signed and stamped by C, which states that the Restrictions in Rule 7 do not apply.

## 8. Opt-In and Opt-Out:
a. All current and former students of C have opted in automatically, and anyone else is opted out until they opt in.  
b. Someone opted out may opt in by showing the Cuéllate symbol or necking themselves.  
c. To temporarily opt out, one may say, “I am opting out of Cuéllate via Rule Eight,” which enables them to opt out until twenty-eight days pass or they opt in, whichever is sooner.  
d. Someone cannot opt out multiple times in one day.  
e. C may opt someone in if they opted out to avoid an active forced Cuéllate.

# III. Validation
1. Any new version of the rules must be signed and stamped by C.
2. To validate the new version, C must inform that the rules have changed and publicly display the new version, which invalidates the previous version.
