# I. Definitions
1. In these rules, A will refer to someone that forces a Cuéllate, B will refer to the person it's forced on, C will refer to Señor Brown, and D will refer to a student.
2. The Cuéllate symbol is formed by extending your thumb out sideways, then touching your other fingers on that hand to it.

# II. Rules
## 1. Forcing a Cuéllate:
a. If B sees A forming the Cuéllate symbol below A's waist, A has "forced a Cuéllate."  
b. If A forces a Cuéllate and no rules below state otherwise, B must slap themself on the back of their neck, or "neck themself."  
c. If A forces a Cuéllate on B, but B doesn't neck themself, A may slap you on the back of the neck, or "neck you."

## 2. Scoring:
a. One earns a point every time they force a Cuéllate and loses a point every time a Cuéllate is forced on them.

## 3. Test Days:
a. A test day is any day where C gives a major grade to D, or C is administering a standardized test required for D by someone other than C.  
b. C may force a Cuéllate on test days, but if D forces a Cuéllate on a test day, it is forced on them.

## 4. Past Forcing:
a. If A forces a Cuéllate on B, but neither A nor B neck B within 1 hour, the forced Cuéllate ends.  
b. If A necks B without a valid forced Cuéllate, A must neck themselves, too.

## 5. Temporary Rule Changes:
a. C may temporarily add or change a rule by stating “Changed Rule” followed by the number of the changed Rule and text of the Rule to add or change.  
b. C may temporarily void a rule by stating “Void Rule” followed by the number of the Rule to void.  
c. This change applies to any active forced Cuéllate, and all forced Cuéllate for one hour.  
d. C may permanently change a rule by editing this sheet.

## 6. Permanent Rule Changes:
a. C may permanently change a rule by validating a new version of the Rule sheet, which invalidates any previous versions of the Rules.  
b. Modifications to this sheet by someone other than C are invalid.

# III. Validation
1. In order for the rules to be valid, they must be signed by C.
2. Once that happens, C must inform that the rules have changed and publicly display the new version.
