1. In the Rules, A will refer to someone that forces a Cuéllate, B will refer to the person it's forced on, C will refer to Señor Brown, and D will refer to a student.
2. The main Cuéllate symbol is formed by extending your thumb out sideways, then touching your other fingers on that hand to it.
3. The Circle Game symbol, which may be used interchangeably with the main Cuéllate symbol, which has a Unicode point of 1F44C, is formed by connecting the thumb and index finger into a circle and holding the other fingers straight or relaxed away from the palm.
4. If B slaps B on the back of the neck, B has “necked” themself, or if A slaps B on the back of the neck A has “necked” B.
5. Any action by A that requires B to neck themself, or A to neck B if B refuses, is called a “forced Cuéllate,” or alternatively, A has “forced a Cuéllate.”
6. The Rules will refer to the Cuéllate symbol, meaning any symbol that can force a Cuéllate.
7. No two Rules may have the same number or name, such that the number and title of a Rule is interchangeable.

# II. Rules
## 1. Forcing a Cuéllate:
a. The Restrictions on forcing a Cuéllate, and who to give the 3 penalty automatically forced Cuéllate to, are the following:  
&#9;i. If physically, the Cuéllate symbol must be below A’s waist, penalized by B on A.  
&#9;ii. If in a picture, the picture must contain A’s face, penalized by B on A.  
&#9;iii. A third party, who is neither A nor B, may not have told A to force it, penalized by B on the third party.  
&#9;iv. A may not place the Cuéllate symbol directly in B’s sight, but must divert B’s attention to it, penalized by B on A.  
b. A has forced a Cuéllate if B sees A showing the Cuéllate symbol, either physically or in a picture, A does not have more than one hundred active forced Cuéllate, and no restrictions (in Rule 7) apply.  
c. If B puts their index finger through the hole of the forced Cuéllate without looking at it, B has forced the Cuéllate, not A.  
d. A and B may create alternative ways to force a Cuéllate by agreement, or by another Rule.  
e. If A forces a Cuéllate on B, but neither A nor B neck B within 1 hour, then it becomes inactive, and no points are scored.  
f. If A necks B without a valid forced Cuéllate, A must neck themselves, too, or B may neck A without a valid forced Cuéllate.  
g. If B necks themself even though A didn’t have a valid forced Cuéllate, no points are scored, so B cannot neck A.  

## 2. Scoring:
a. One earns a point every time they force a Cuéllate and loses a point every time a Cuéllate is forced on them.  
b. The game may be played without scoring at all.  
c. The object of the game is to have one hundred and one active forced Cuéllate on someone for as long as possible.  
d. If A reaches one hundred and one active forced Cuéllate on B, A is their “Cuéllate Master” for one hour, which means that for every forced Cuéllate by A, A has actually forced two.

## 3. Personal Property:
a. If B sees A touching B’s property in a non-damaging way, which has an instruction not to touch it, A has forced a Cuéllate.  
b. If A continues to do so for more than five seconds, A has forced an additional Cuéllate, or three if more than fifteen seconds.  
c. If B is able to reclaim the property before A lets go of it, B has forced three Cuéllate, and A has not forced any.

## 4. Opt-In and Opt-Out:
a. Anyone who has forced a Cuéllate before is opted in, and anyone else is opted out until they force a Cuéllate.  
b. Someone opted out, who had been opted in before and wasn’t automatically opted out, may opt in by necking themselves.  
c. Someone who was automatically opted out may opt in by forcing a Cuéllate or necking themselves.  
d. To temporarily opt out, one may say, “I am opting out of Cuéllate via Rule Four,” which enables them to opt out until twenty-eight days pass or they opt in, whichever is sooner.
e. Someone cannot opt out multiple times in one day.  
f. Someone cannot opt out if someone has an active forced Cuéllate on them.  
g. If no activity occurs for one year for someone opted in, they have opted out automatically.

## 5. Rule Changes:
a. This Rule cannot be modified by any other Rules.  
b. A Rule can be added or changed by the signer of the Rules if they state “I append” or “I change” or “I activate” or an equivalent expression, followed by the number of the changed Rule and text of the Rule to add or change.  
c. A Rule can be voided by the signer of the Rules by stating “I void” or “I deactivate” or an equivalent expression, followed by the number of the Rule to void.  
d. This change affects all forced Cuéllate forced while it’s valid and is valid ten minutes before validation to an hour after.  
e. When a change becomes invalid, any completed actions done during the valid period are still legal, including their lasting effects, but the change is no longer in effect, so those actions cannot be performed again.  
f. A valid temporary rule change may be invalidated via another temporary rule change that invalidates it.  
g. The creator of a temporary change must state any valid temporary changes if someone asks them, “I request information of any valid temporary changes via Rule Five,” without anything being done to the asker.  
h. A rule may be permanently changed by validating a new version of the Rule sheet, via Section III, which invalidates any previous versions of the Rules, all Temporary Rule Changes, and their lasting effects.  
i. Modifications to the Rules by someone other than the signer of the Rules are invalid, unless they validate and approve them.

# III. Validation
1. Any new version of the rules must be signed and stamped by C, and be publicly displayed, which invalidates the previous version.
