Rules of Cuéllate, version 7  
Valid since: March 5, 2020

# I. Definitions
1. In the Rules, A will refer to someone that forces a Cuéllate, and B will refer to the person it's forced on.
2. The main Cuéllate symbol is formed by extending your thumb out sideways, then touching your other fingers on that hand to it.
3. The Circle Game symbol, which may be used interchangeably with the main Cuéllate symbol, which has a Unicode point of 1F44C, is formed by connecting the thumb and index finger into a circle and holding the other fingers straight or relaxed away from the palm.
4. If B slaps B on the back of the neck, B has “necked” themself, or if A slaps B on the back of the neck, A has “necked” B.
5. Any action by A that requires B to neck themself, or A to neck B if B refuses, is called a “forced Cuéllate,” or alternatively, A has “forced a Cuéllate.”
6. The Rules will refer to the Cuéllate symbol, meaning any symbol that can force a Cuéllate.
7. No two Rules in the same version may have the same number or name, such that at any time the number and title of a Rule is interchangeable.

# II. Rules
## 1. Forcing a Cuéllate:
a. A has forced a Cuéllate if B sees A showing the Cuéllate symbol, either physically or in a picture, A does not have more than one hundred active forced Cuéllate, and no Restrictions apply, (penalized by 3 forced Cuéllate if broken,) which are the following:  
&#9;i. If physically, the Cuéllate symbol must be below A’s waist, penalized by B on A.  
&#9;ii. If in a picture, the picture must contain A’s face, penalized by B on A.  
&#9;iii. A third party, who is neither A nor B, may not have told A to force it, penalized by B on the third party.  
&#9;iv. A may not place the Cuéllate symbol directly in B’s sight, but must divert B’s attention to it, penalized by B on A.  
b. If a Restriction only partially applies, or is on the borderline, to decide, a game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" must be played.  
c. If B puts their index finger through the hole of the forced Cuéllate without looking at it, B has forced the Cuéllate, not A.  
d. A and B may create alternative ways to force a Cuéllate by agreement, or by another Rule.  
e. If A forces a Cuéllate on B, but neither A nor B neck B within 1 hour, then it becomes inactive, and no points are scored.  
f. If A necks B without a valid forced Cuéllate, A must neck themselves, too, or B may neck A without a valid forced Cuéllate.  
g. If B necks themself even though A didn’t have a valid forced Cuéllate, no points are scored, so B cannot neck A.  
h. If B contests that they have not seen a Cuéllate symbol, but correctly identified it as such, A has forced two Cuéllate, regardless of any Restrictions.

## 2. Scoring:
a. If scoring is being used, a point is earned every time they force a Cuéllate, but a point is lost every time a Cuéllate is forced on them.  
b. The object of the game is to have one hundred one active forced Cuéllate on someone for as long as possible.  
c. If A reaches one hundred one active forced Cuéllate on B, A is their “Cuéllate Master” for one hour, which means that for every forced Cuéllate by A, A has actually forced two.

## 3. Personal Property:
a. If B sees A touching B’s property in a non-damaging way, which has an instruction not to touch it, A has forced a Cuéllate.  
b. If A continues to do so for more than five seconds, A has forced an additional Cuéllate, or three if more than fifteen seconds.  
c. If B is able to reclaim the property before A lets go of it, B has forced three Cuéllate, and A has not forced any.

## 4. Opt-In and Opt-Out:
a. Anyone who has forced a Cuéllate before is opted in, and anyone else is opted out until they force a Cuéllate.  
b. Someone opted out, who had been opted in before and wasn’t automatically opted out, may opt in by necking themselves.  
c. Someone who was automatically opted out may opt in by forcing a Cuéllate or necking themselves.  
d. To temporarily opt out, one may say, “I am opting out of Cuéllate via Rule Four,” which enables them to opt out until 28 days pass or they opt in, whichever is sooner.
e. Someone cannot opt out multiple times in one day.  
f. Someone cannot opt out if someone has an active forced Cuéllate on them.  
g. If no activity occurs for one year for someone opted in, they have opted out automatically.

# III. Validation
1. Additional Rules may be added, or a new version used, by agreement of all parties involved.
2. These Rules go into effect as soon as they are publicly posted, if all parties agree to use the new version.
