Rules of Cuéllate (Señor Brown Edition)  
Valid since: April 24, 2019

# 0. Definitions:
a. In these rules, A will refer to someone that forces a Cuéllate, and B the person it's forced on.  
b. The Cuéllate symbol is formed by extending your thumb out sideways, then touching your other fingers on that hand to it.

# 1. Forcing a Cuéllate:
a. If B sees A forming the Cuéllate symbol below A's waist, A has "forced a Cuéllate."  
b. If A forces a Cuéllate and no rules below state otherwise, B must slap themself on the back of their neck, or "neck themself."  
c. If A forces a Cuéllate on B, but B doesn't neck themself, A may slap you on the back of the neck, or "neck you."

# 2. Scoring:
a. One earns a point every time they force a Cuéllate, and loses every time a Cuéllate is forced on them.

# 3. Test Days:
a. Only Señor Brown may force a Cuéllate on test days.  
b. If someone else forces a Cuéllate on a test day, it is forced on them.

# 4. Past Forcing:
a. If A forces a Cuéllate on B, but neither A nor B neck B within 1 hour, the forced Cuéllate ends.  
b. If A necks B without a valid forced Cuéllate, they must neck themself, too.

# 5. Adding Rules:
a. Señor Brown may temporarily add or void a rule by stating the text of the rule.  
b. This change applies to any active forced Cuéllate, and all forced Cuéllate for one hour.
