Valid since: March 5, 2020

# IV. Unfair Additions
## 1. Rules of Unfair Additions:
a. The Unfair Additions are additional Rules subject to the Terms of Section III.1.  
b. These additions are no longer in effect if a new version of these Additions becomes effective, all parties agree to no longer use them, or a new version of the Rules incompatible with these Additions becomes effective.  
c. The Unfair Additions, by nature, are somewhat unfair to one or more parties, but if a party chooses to complain about their unfairness, four Cuéllate are forced by the other party.  
d. C may be used in these Additions to refer to Señor Brown, D may be used to refer to a student, and E may be used to refer to everyone that D applies to.  
e. An Unfair Addition may be deactivated or reactivated by C at any time, without prior notice, just by verbally stating it has been deactivated or reactivated.  
f. At the time the Unfair Additions go into effect, all Additions are active, unless stated otherwise.  
g. If there is an unresolvable dispute concerning the Rules or Additions between A and B, and it is not obvious from reading the Rule or Addition in question, C is automatically right, or if neither A nor B is C, whoever is older is automatically right.

## 2. Test Days:
a. A test day is any day where C gives a major grade or is administering a standardized test for D.  
b. A pseudo-test day is any day where C gives a non-major grade or is administering another grade for D.  
c. C may force a Cuéllate on test days, but if D forces a Cuéllate on a test day, it is forced on them.  
d. C may force a Cuéllate on pseudo-test days, but if D forces a Cuéllate while the grade is still being administered or given, nothing is forced.  
e. If D makes a loud or disruptive noise on a test, or pseudo-test, day, C has forced four Cuéllate on D.  
f. For every mistake D makes on a non-major grade from C, C has forced a Cuéllate.

## 3. Neck Bank:
a. If D wishes to neck themselves in advance for a future forced Cuéllate, D must deposit their electronic device, which must have been worth at least three hundred dollars on its release date, with C for the duration that they wish to store their advance “necks,” along with the number of “necks” to deposit.  
b. When D wishes to withdraw the advance “necks,” D may simply reclaim their electronic device, and the “necks” are released, as if D had just necked themself that many times.  
c. If this Addition is deactivated, any stored “necks” are instantly released.

## 4. Protesting Authority:
a. C has forced ten Cuéllate on D if D protests Jesus, His rules, or their validity, five if D protests a rule made by a higher authority than C, and three if D protests a class rule made by C.  
b. C has forced two Cuéllate on D if D says that C is not “good-looking” or “guapo,” or three if D says something that C “takes as an insult.”

## 5. Exemptions:
a. A is exempt from the Restrictions on forcing Cuéllate in Rule 1 (they don’t apply) if A has a physical Exemption Pass signed and stamped by C, which states that the Restrictions in Rule 1 do not apply while the seventh Unfair Addition is active.  
b. Any Exemption Pass stating the above with a different Rule instead of this Addition has been invalidated upon activation of this Addition.

## 6. Explosives:
a. This Addition is inactive until directly activated by C.  
b. Just Neck Yourself:  
&#9;i. A Cuéllate shall automatically be forced by C on E once every minute.  
&#9;ii. At the last second of every hour, for every valid active forced Cuéllate on E, they are invalidated, and two new valid active forced Cuéllate are forced on E.  
c. Nuclear Bomb:  
&#9;i. This Addition deactivates all Rules, and all Unfair Additions, except for the first Unfair Addition and this Addition.   
&#9;ii. For each individual time E looks at C, C has forced a Cuéllate, but E may not force a Cuéllate in any way.  
d. Golden Addition:  
&#9;i. If A manually forces a Cuéllate on B, B automatically forces a Cuéllate on A.  
&#9;ii. This Addition has forced a Cuéllate on E while it is valid, which cannot be invalidated or deactivated.
